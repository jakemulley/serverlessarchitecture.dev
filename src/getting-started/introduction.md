## What is serverless?

Serverless (short for "serverless computing") is a cloud-native architectural pattern. It allows developers to focus on developing and running applications and services in the cloud, without having to manage underlying servers themselves. Serverless is still backed by servers, but the management is abstracted away to a cloud provider, such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure (Azure)](https://azure.microsoft.com), or [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com).

Utilising serverless architecture offsets the need for a developer to provision, maintain, and scale servers. This includes maintenance, patching, capacity planning and management, and the scalability and availability of servers.

Historically, "serverless" has been synonymous with "[Function as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service)" (FaaS). More recently, cloud providers have started to offer serverless equivalents of traditional infrastructure, such as databases, queuing systems, event buses, blob storage, and API gateways.

That's all serverless is: cloud services that don't require a developer to manage the underlying servers and the complexities that come with that.
